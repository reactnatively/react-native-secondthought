# React Natively

Projects that use React Native to tell the story of humanity. Here we'll capture how humans interact with each other using technology.

## SecondThought
We're creating a simple app to allow iOS &amp; Android users that allows the starting and stopping of audio recording while famous quotes loop in the background.

Users should be able to:
* press record which would begin recording audio to their device
* as well as upload a final audio file to our AWS S3 bucket. 

_PLEASE NOTE: It is important that this app be developed with React Native because we want to deploy to our student group for testing on either iOS or Android devices._
